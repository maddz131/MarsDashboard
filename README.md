# MarsDashboard

This dashboard that consumes the NASA API. It allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. 

This app makes use of all the functional concepts and practices learned in Udacity Javascript Nanodegree course, and demonstrates comfort with using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses.
