# Functional Programming with Javascript 

## Mars Dashboard

As a part of the Udacity Intermediate Javascript Nanodegree course, I've created a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. My dashboard allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. My app makes use of all the functional concepts and practices I have learned in the course. The goal was that I would become very comfortable using pure functions and iterating over, reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses.
